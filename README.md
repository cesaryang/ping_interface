To address the requirement of generating a script to ping all interfaces with jumbo packets based on the provided interface configurations in interface1.log, it's important to correct and clarify the approach based on the provided context and requirements. Given the task involves handling a large number of interfaces (over 70) and ensuring the MTU settings allow for jumbo packet transmission, the script should extract the IPv4 addresses from the interface configurations and then construct ping commands with a specified packet size that qualifies as a jumbo packet (typically larger than the standard 1500 bytes MTU for Ethernet).
